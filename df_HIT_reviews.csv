Once you've learned it (took me about 15 minutes) then it is easy, yet a challenge at the same time. The graphics are OK for a NES game, but I've seen much better on the NES. This game has almost all of the characters, except Doctor Crusher, and Counselor Troi, and they all serve a purpouse on the bridge. This game is quite complex for a NES game (I guess that's why the graphics aren't so good, because they had to make room to store the game)The game doesn't save your progress, however it has a password system (but don't worry, all the passcodes are 4 letters long, and are not hard to remember)  Get this game, the few dollars are worth it!",Star Trek: The Next Generation - Nintendo NES,ABSOLUTE VIDEO GAMES,Pair_A36BNNPV9REL0X-B00004SVUZ

B0050SYWGU,A2WODLH7HB6KJC,ADavis,5,2011-10-21 00:00:00,1319155200,Great Game!,33.0,"I have had this game for a few hours now, and I can already feel myself getting better. It comes with the guitar, two picks, a strap, a USB cord, and a regular guitar cord (for plugging into an amp). It's very easy to set up. You take it out, plug it in, and you're good to go. It takes you through a brief tutorial on how to play, and then tunes the strings, telling you how to do it. Before every song, it has you retune your guitar for that song, or makes sure your guitar is still in tune. Then you play. At first glance, it is very intimidating, especially if you're used to playing Rock Band or Guitar Hero. Stick with it, though. It gets easier as you go. As you get better, it introduces new techniques, and offers a ""challenge"" to better teach you how to play using those techniques. I am a beginner guitar player. I played a number of years ago, and didn't take formal lessons. I jumped right in and felt at home. You have two options; you can play your ""journey,"" where you practice a few songs, get a high enough score to qualify, then go perform them to move on. Your other option is to just jump into whatever song you wish. I found myself doing both. The bottom line is, if you were having second thoughts about buying this game, just go for it. If you want to learn how to play, you will. It really is wonderful. Yes, the guitar is a ""cheaper"" version, but if you're just starting to learn, you don't need anything better. And the good thing is, once you get better, you can buy a better guitar and use it for this game because it works with ANY GUITAR. It honestly is wonderful.

B0041RUM0Q,A2TUSRGNWHJHH6,Nicholas Cassel,3,2011-02-17 00:00:00,1297900800,Get's the job done,11,"I bought this charger around December and so far this is what I can tell you about it.  cons.   1. There's no way to tell how charged te batteries are using the xbox button in the middle of the xbox controller, when you do the bars for the battery life are always full so you won't know when the charge is going to run out.    2. The charging stand where you put the batteries on isn't designed very well for charging the batteries without them being attached to the controller, if you try and charge them without it connected to the controller you have to try and line it up just right with the little LED on the charging dock and the battery, if you don't the light showing you how charged the battery is will stay red (no/low battery power) and will never change to yellow or green (fully/high battery power), resulting in you over charging the battery. The easiest way to prevent that is to just have the battery connected to an xbox 360 controller when you charge it and it will slide right into place. (P.S. I myself might have accidentally over charged the batteries because the light indicator showing how charged the battery is will only go to yellow. I'm not sure if this was caused by me or if the batteries themselves were defective or something of that nature.)    3. The average time the batteries last after being charged is around 3 to 5 hours of use, which is abit shorter than other batteries but if you aren't using both of them and have a second xbox 360 controller (you can charge the batteries without them being attached to the controller, it's just harder to line them up with the charging bay!) you can pop the dead battery into there and put that on the charging bay and then rotate them when those batteries get dead. If you are using both of the battery packs at the same time however get ready for some downtime for you and your friend for the batteries to recharge.    4. The instructions that come with the ""Xbox 360 Power Base Induction Charger"" do not tell you how long you should charge the batteries for or how long you shouldn't charge the batteries for in case the light indicator is messed up or something. (As stated above my batteries no longer show a green light when charging and will only show a yellow one.)  Pros.   1. The batteries work, I've had them for a few months now and they still stay charged for 3-5 hours of use.    2. You can use rumble without the the xbox 360 controller turning off (I'm talking about the issue for the xbox 360 controller where when you use rumble the batteries jiggle out of place for a moment and then that turns off your xbox controller which can get really annoying for online play or playing in general. Here's a video showing you a fix for that problem in case you decide not to buy these. [...])    3. They are really light making the xbox 360 controller alot lighter (Not sure if everyone sees that as a pro, but I do.)    4. The charging dock is small and lets you charge two batteries at once and they don't have to be connected to the controller to charge (but it is harder to charge them without being connected to a controller.  I would also like to add that I do not know if the batteries automatically stop charging the batteries once the charge light turns green to prevent over charging the battery, but I it might. If anyone knows a added comment to confirm would be great.",Xbox 360 Power Base Induction Charger - Black,dreamGEAR,Pair_A2TUSRGNWHJHH6-B0041RUM0Q

It is fun, action packed, and the way the story changes from present Wesley Gibson to past Cross and back again is really a treat for fans of the movie and comic book alike.  The controls are really easy to get used to, only took me about 30 seconds, especially since there is a tutorial showing you all of the movies in the game.  I love the way you can curve bullets, especially while playing Cross with the semi-automatic.  Gameplay is very smooth and quick with the exception of when your playing a 'boss'.  I will say this; it is difficult to know when your life is low unless you pay attention to the brightness and color scheme of the screen.  When the screen goes gray, you are about to die... but if you take cover for a couple of seconds, your life builds again.  Enough praise, now here is my one gripe.. I wish the game had a multiplayer.  I know so many people that buy this game will only dream of a massive online multiplayer experience where you get to curve bullets, design your own assasin, and hit the open terrain in crazy bullet flying online action.  Even if no online multiplayer at least shoot for an online co-op where a friend can join in on the game sort of in a time crisis kind of way.  Overall, I think this is an awesome game.  I have no complaints as of yet.  I played it for a couple hours last night and am ready to plop down on the couch for some more bullet bending fun.  Pick this game up if you want to be entertained and liked either Stronghold and/or Bourne Conspiracy as a few aspects from those games seep through the cracks of Wanted: Weapons of Fate.  You will not be disappointed with this game if you want to have a fun gaming experience.

B0029MAXR2,A2R6GE92NRZAWE,Va- Bank,5,2009-09-30 00:00:00,1254268800,The wait is over.,19,"I almost bought an Xbox 360 just to play Ninja Gaiden 2.  Luckily, if you only have a PS3 you can have this not-so-new, but improved game. I'm a huge fan of the series and this one bears the Ninja Gaiden name proudly. You can get an overview of the game in better places then my review, so I'll just get to the point:   - Game looks and plays fantastic. No slowdown, which 360 owners were reporting, but just a minor occurence of screen-tearing, barely noticeable and does not affect the experience.  - Difficulty. This is no easy game, but it's by far the easiest Ninja Gaiden I ever played. Veterans will find their challenge in difficulty settings that will get unlocked after you play through the game the first time. Newcomers to the series will enjoy the action without smashing their controllers when playing on Alcolyte and Warrior modes offered from the beginning. I think it was a smart decision on part of developers.  - Blood and Gore. Many people have complained about the removal of over-the-top blood and gore that Ninja Gaiden 2 on Xbox was famous for. I'd say the level of depiction of violence in Sigma 2 is on par with Sigma 1 - some blood, but nothing like the Xbox version. What I don't understand is why this game is still rated M.  - New Characters. These are actually fun to play with, not just thrown in for the sake of putting them on the game cover.  In short, I recommend this to anyone who likes action games. Previous Ninja Gaiden games were not for everyone due to their crushing difficulty. The only exception to my recommendation: if you already played Ninja Gaiden 2 on Xbox, you may not find that this game is worth the full price. If not - get it, it's one of the best games this year.",Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 (PS3),Tecmo Koei,Pair_A2R6GE92NRZAWE-B0029MAXR2

B0002KMHD6,A3CHOZ6EWUG3PR,Lindsey C.,4,2004-11-15 00:00:00,1100476800,more fun than setting stuff on fire...,110,"Talk about the next generation of gaming, this game is so awesome I reccomend to everyone and anyone. This is a PERFECT Christmas present, and is for sure my new favorite game. Although there are a few draw backs to the game, which I have experienced myelf:  *-*LIGHTNING*-* oh my GOD the eye toy is annoying, this is the biggest draw back to the game is the picky lighting and calibration, if you don't have a room with decent lighting i suggest you don't get it. My game is SO picky I had to buy a shop light just for the thing to work. Kind of a draw back, and a bit aggrivating...  *-*Another thing to add to the lighting is the calibration, the eye toy is out dated for the technology used in anti-grav, making it a bit difficult when the lighting is just slightly off. It can mistake your hand or arm for your face, so when you move your arm up to reach for something, it thinks your jumping. Something that REALLY made me mad...  *-*Yet another thing to add to the lighting is that if you get the lighting to work my just well turning on a light, be warned the stupid camera picks up shadows. So the shadows of your arms is might mistake for your head!  But if you do get it working, it is so much fun, just pure awesomeness in a box. Assuming you have some paitence, this game is for you. Even for the less physically fit among us. That's another cool part about this game is that you can get a work out from just waving your arms around, crouching and jumping. So if your a lazy game (like myself) who doesn't want to be bothered exercising, this is another game for you! Exercise and fun all in one.  Another thing I wanna point out is the soundtrack. Personally I like pop/punk, but I really like the music. A cool thing about the music is that it's not jsut computer generated, ad actually band worked ot make a soundtrack! It's awesome.  The graphics are nice, not awesome, but nice. Since your mostly moving the whole time it really doesn't matter all that much. So now you PS2 owners won't have to be jealous of Xbox owners who have Halo 2, now you can shove a futuristic game in thier face that no one else with a different console can play. Although on Xbox the graphics would be better, PS2 had it first. And I agree with another comment in the last review, online play would be AWESOME! My mom would start to wonder why I would be crouching and talking to the television, but hey, whatever.  My overall impression is get the game, it's worth a try. And if the ligting really doesn't work for you, just return it and buy something else. GET THIS GAME! IT'S AWESOME! The only thing that brought down my rating is the lighting thing, it was a gloomy day today, and there for my game wouldn't work quite right.",Eyetoy Antigrav with Camera - PlayStation 2,Sony,Pair_A3CHOZ6EWUG3PR-B0002KMHD6
B0001DHQPI,A33YIZBDNCZQ1F,Ian Mok,5,2004-11-21 00:00:00,1100995200,Amazing. Enough said.,10,"Rainbow Six 3 is simply one of the best games out there for the Gamecube - extremely fun AND re-playable, Six 3 has amazing gameplay, controls and a realism that will make you want to keep playing hours on end.    GRAPHICS - phenomenal; not ""blocky"" in the slightest sense, and crafted with a loving attention to detail. Every scenario is smooth and refreshingly unique as a result (making gameplay so much better!!) thus giving the game an excellent sense of realism. You feel like you're actually there and not sitting in front of the TV playing a game - try the Alcatraz or Penthouse levels to see what I mean!!    MISSIONS and GAMEPLAY - Highly re-playable; I've completed it on various difficulty settings and am still taken by surprise at how fresh all the levels seem. This is because Six 3 has a very good variety of scenarios (you fight in different geographical locations such as Venezuela, Saudia Arabia or San Fransisco) AND a consistent storyline. You are the leader of a squad and it's therefore in your best interest to keep you men alive - and they're great at covering you in a tight situation. The command orders are not hard to use and the ""zulu function"" - whereby you can make a team wait before breaching/entering a room - is ingenious, and therefore your Rainbow team members become assets, not people who get in the way of combat.    MUSIC AND SOUND- Perfect. I used to study film score composition and this is an excellent piece of writing for the game; it comes on in crucial moments and can really make chills go up your spine. All the right gun sounds have been used, the explosions are fun and the sound of the enemy is crucial in detecting them. Again, excellent realism.    GUNS + EQUIPMENT - You have an amazing arsenal of weapons to choose from, and each fire realistically. For example, your shotgun is satisfyingly effective at short ranges but can't hit a barn door for longer distances, whilst the assault rifles really do rip into the enemy they get hit. Thermal vision acts like it does in real life as does night vision - from teargas, phosphorus grenades and Desert Eagles you have everything at your disposal, and you will get to use it all during the game!    So as you can probably see Rainbow Six 3 is A MUST HAVE - you haven't lived a true Gamecube experience without playing this. It's fantastic in almost every aspect of it's gameplay, controls and scenarios and provides for many hours of great entertainment.    Buy it, and you'll see what I mean ;)",Rainbow Six 3 - Gamecube,Ubisoft,Pair_A33YIZBDNCZQ1F-B0001DHQPI
