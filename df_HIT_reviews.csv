B000067DPI,A2GJMKHNINTTKX,MJ,3,2003-05-20 00:00:00,1053388800,Good but not Great,4.0,"The game is good.  I admit I have not gotten very deep in the game because it has annoyed me to much for me to stay intrested in it.  However its strongest point is the graphics.  I own the PC version.  I play it on a Laptop with an ATI Mobility Radeon 9000 with 64MB of video ram on a 14in SXGA screen and a 1.4GHz Intel Centrino processor.  The game looks great and plays fast.  (For those of you who only play console games you are missing out on the power of the PC)  The storyline concept adds an interesting twist to the game that gives a little more motivation for winning.  There is a good amount of options for tuning your car's settings for each race.  The tuning options require some testing before you drive in a race because they can make or break your race, but they are not to hard to figure out.  The biggest problem is the physics.  Even in sim mode the cars handle a little unrealistically.  I played F1 2002 for a long time and believe that the physics in that game are excellent.  We all know how great the physics in all the GT games were.  In Pro Race Driver there is no since of acceleration or deceleration.  The car always feels like it is going the same speed whether you are going 150MPH or slamming on the breaks to enter a corner or mashing on the gas to exit the corner.  You have to drive a near perfect race to win because there is no difficulty setting in career mode.  The racing sounds are whack.  There is also no qualifying before the race for starting grid positioning.  You always start out in the 6th, 8th, or 9th spot. (And they call this a racing sim) One other of the things that irritated me is that the A.I. drivers are a little too aggressive at times.  More often than not an A.I. controlled car vying for position would spin me off the track, many times causing me to hit a wall and severely damage my car.  By the time I am able to get back on the track everyone has passed me and I have no chance of getting back into a respectable position in the race due to the vehicle damage and lack of feel for speed.  If you were to ask me I would tell you not to waist your money on this one if you are a hardcore racing fan.  Play f1 2002 and pray that GT4 is made available for the PC.  if you are a casual racing fan that likes storyline twist in your games this is a good game for you.  The week physics engine won't drive you crazy but the A.I. drivers might.",Pro Race Driver,Atari

B000UW21A0,A1Q9XCZ5L0PH54,David Williams,3,2016-02-29 00:00:00,1456704000,Just About Average,2,Uncharted Drake's Fortune had a great game concept and had a great story but in my personal opinion was well executed in every category except gameplay. You will find yourself dying HUNDREDS of times which will really destroy your experience either from traps or due to random instant kills that just randomly happen and to this very day still has yet to be patched. All in all... I honestly was pretty disappointed with the game mainly because of how poorly the shooting mechanics were designed as well as how ridiculous some of the later enemy types are and how hard the game was to play even on the easiest difficulty. And the later platforming will REALLY have you dying and raging a lot as well. In all honesty you might have more fun watching someone play this game rather than playing it yourself due to how faulty the gameplay in this game truly is. All in all it has a good story but... Terrible gameplay. I do not recommend buying this game but instead watching someone play it on YouTube and watching them suffer so that you don't have to. All in all this game gets an average score just because of how good the story was. If not for that... Sony definitely wouldn't have given Naughty Dog the funding to make a sequel to this game.,Uncharted: Drake's Fortune - Playstation 3,Naughty Dog Inc.

In this game you play a sword wielding, turban wearing adventurer who must pass the most perilous of tests.  The game plays alot like the tomb raider series.  It is 3rd person perspective and is full of alot of purple hues.  There are several puzzle types throughout the game and countless sword swinging encounters with baddies. There are many areas to explore and goggle at and the length of the adventure is adequate.  The sound and graphics look great on the DC, and the controls are fairly easy after a little practice.  If you played the original POP or are looking for some action adventure video gaming pick it up you will enjoy yourself.",Prince of Persia: Arabian Nights,Sega

B00AR03O92,A3R30JD03L26N4,Ptaaty,4,2013-02-02 00:00:00,1359763200,Great mix of Metroidvania adventure and twin stick shooter.,2.0,"You might be looking at the MS 5 pack wondering if it is worth it....yep.

This game is great, easily worth over $5 in my now skewed ultra value PC sense (having $20 of fun with it in another words).

You gain explore and gain abilities after beating bosses which in turn open new areas previously inaccessable.  You can revisit any part of the large interconnected map (think medroid-vania style).  In addition there are hidden/off the normal path powerups to your weapons / abilities.

It uses the dual-stick control method if you are using a controller (highly recommended)....like Geometry Wars or Super Stardust HD, but slower paced.  You can switch abilities you've gained at any time, with 4 being allocated to hot-buttons on a controller.

I am about 50% done with this but wanted to get a review up to anyone still on the fence...the 5 game MS pack is so worth it.",Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet [Download],Shadow Planet Productions

Whitmer,3,2011-06-30 00:00:00,1309392000,Decent,2,"Ok so you get 2 things here, 2 back triggers (very back buttons) that are extended and curved so your fingers don't slip off easily, i like these except they are a little long and poke you finger if you put your fingers under the triggers like i do, not a big deal though. The stick accessorie to me is pointless! Its a cheap piece of plastic thats kind of hard to put on. All it will do is get in my way so i won't be using these. the 3 dollars i spent for these are worth it just for the back triggers.",PS3 Trigger and Stick,Subsonic

B000GP6HQA,A54A3V9TDHMKC,T. Dang,4,2007-12-31 00:00:00,1199059200,my favorite mouse so far,2,"I bought this mouse because of its design.  I wanted a functional, ambidexterous mouse with 5 buttons and high resolution.  The scroll wheel surface has a grippy smooth surface.  Scrolling action is quiet and solid with noticeable indents and its middle button clicks loudest of the six.  It has good weight, durable grippy surfaces, and large gliding feets.  the matte black finish on the large buttons and rear of mouse is really nice (not too smooth, not too rough), feels durable, and the buttons do not wobble.  I claw my mouse everyday and I have not notice any wear or surface corrosion except on the mouse's feet.  The two large buttons have a noticeable click to them.  The side buttons doesn't sound and isn't as crisp as the 1-3 button.  This simple mouse seems built to last.  One negative is that it is sometimes hard to tell if you have pressed the resolution switching button  (feels cheap/wobbly, looks cheap as well), so be attuned to the speed of the cursor.  I have small hands and can reach all buttons comfortably so all my fingers get a good workout. I hope they come out with games where you can control things with two mouses!  I bought one over a year ago and I got another one when it was on sale.",Logitech G3 Laser Mouse (931691-0403),Logitech

The bigger controller reminds me a lot more of the much superior xbox 360 controller. The L2 and R2 triggers are way better than the ones on the dualshock. The spring action feels right and your fingers don't slip off of them. Also the sticks are stiffer and feel more accurate for fps and racing games. Im very impressed with it. In their next version if they add rumble then they will have the perfect controller. As is I give it a 4.5.,PS3 Wireless Controller,Psyclone Games
B001E8VB3C,A2OR09N5HH20PY,Raul Duke,5,2009-08-25 00:00:00,1251158400,Best Comic Game Ever Made,4,"i haven't gotten far enough to give too many details on the story, outside of the fact that joker has planned a trap for batman, and not only is he going to have to face his toughest villains (Joker, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Bane, ect) and bring them to justice, he'll be fighting for his own life as he has been locked in Arkham Asylum with all the inmates thanks to the Joker, who is now in total control of Arkham.

controls handle perfectly, this is by far the best Batman game ever made, you truly feel like batman, from the gadgets and fighting style to the detective aspect of the game, this game hits every note perfectly, for the first time ever in a game you are the batman.

graphics are fantastic, every little detail throughout arkham is rendered perfectly, everything from the smallest details in a room to the character models are crisp and well done.

the game is set in a semi-open world style, similar to Bioshock's levels. every area of Arkham Asylum, inside and out, can be explored eventually.

voice acting is spot on, with the original voice actors of Batman and the Joker from Batman: The Animated Series.

basically its the best game overall we've seen so far this year, and it will most likely go down as the best Batman game of all time.", Batman,WB Games
